## Hexadecimal binary converter

Implement a function that converts a hexadecimal number (as a string) into a binary number (as a string).  Also implement the inverse function (binary -> hexadecimal).  Write tests for these. If your language (or language's standard library) provides such functionality for you, mention it but implement it yourself.

To run the script use `npm run hexaBinaryConverter`, to run the tests use `npm run test-hexaBinaryConverter`
